### Catalog Course Description

> This course will cover simple linear regresssion with extension to multiple linear regression models including model selection, validation, diagnostics and remedial measures. Additionally, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), multiple treatment comparisons, factorial ANOVA, randomized complete-block designs, analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), ANOVA with unbalanced data, fixed-/random-/mixed-effect models, repeated-measures designs, and nested designs.

>Lecture Hours: 3

>Grade Mode: Normal, Audit
>Prerequisites: STAT7110 >= C and STAT7510 >= C
>Repeat Status: No
>Schedule Type: Lecture, Asynchronous Instruction

### Student Learning Outcomes

At the end of the course, students will be capable of analyzing data using linear regression, ANOVA, mixed-effect models, and other related methods.  This will include cleaning and visualization of the data, choosing an appropriate model design, diagnosing model performance, and preparing summary plots and a written report interpreting the results of the analysis.

### Course Evaluation and Grading

#### Assessments

- 4 Homework Assignments **(50%)**
- 1 Midterm Exam **(20%)**
- 1 (Course Project) **(30%)**
- Professionalism **(3%)**
  
##### Homework Assignments
  
  - Homework assignments consist of a combination of theory and application problems based on the lecture and book material, and involve, e.g., coding, mathematical derivations, and interpreting model results.
- Due date will typically be 1 - 2 weeks after it is assigned.
- Late assignments will not be accepted without prior approval.
- Your submitted assignments should be organized, with the assignment number, your name, and the date all clearly visible on the first page. 
- Any results, derivations, or any other form of work you include that is not your own must be cited with a full reference.
- I **strongly** prefer you type your assignments using $\LaTeX$ or Markdown.
- Homework submission will occur online.  See the course webpage for further instructions.

##### Midterm Exam

- In-class, closed book, one page of notes (standard letter paper, front and back).
- Questions similar to homework assignments.
- Specific material covered and further details on the exam will be provided in class.

##### Course Project

Students will be tasked with conducting a thorough analysis on a real world data set, producing a written report that includes a practical interpretation of results. Students will need to: find a real world data set, identify a question of interest that can be assessed with the data, develop and apply the appropriate linear model, and interpret the model results to answer the motivating question.  Students will be required to make use of statistical modeling software (R, Python, ~~SAS~~) to conduct their analyses and generate the required plots.

##### Professionalism

For full credit in this category you must consistently attend class and complete the course evaluations at the end of the term.

#### Grading Scale

A-F Grading Scale:
  
  A: >= 90% & <= 100% 
  
  B: >= 80% & < 90% 
  
  C: >= 70% & < 80% 
  
  D: >= 60% & < 70% 
  
  F: < 60%

### Policies & Guidelines

Students are required to follow and be aware of the Augusta University Student Attendance Policy, which states 

>regular, punctual attendance is expected of students in all courses at Augusta University and is counted at >the first class meeting each term. Faculty members are required to monitor student attendance and ongoing >participation in the course.  Additional attendance requirements may be established by the individual schools >or programs as well as by the individual faculty member in each course.  Students who incur an excessive >number of absences, as defined by the faculty member and/or college, may be subject to academic penalty.

The full Student Attendance policy can be found in the AU Policy Library at https://www.augusta.edu/compliance/policyinfo/policies.php, 
and from the Graduate School at https://www.augusta.edu/gradschool/student-resources.php.

#### Course Attendance Policy

- Please inform me in advance, either in person or by email, if you anticipate being absent.
- In case of emergency that prevents contacting me prior to the class meeting, inform me as soon as you can.
- If you anticipate consecutive absences or an extended period of absence, contact me to discuss arrangments.
- Being absent does not permit you to turn in an assignment late.
- Frequent absenteeism will be frowned upon :(
  
#### AU Academic Honesty Policy
  
  > "Augusta University (“AU”) recognizes that academic honesty is essential to its academic function. The following regulations protect the equity and validity of the University’s grades and degrees, and help students develop ethical standards and attitudes appropriate to academic and professional life.
