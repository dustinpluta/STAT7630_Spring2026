## Problems

1. Weisberg: 2.1.1, 2.1.2, 2.1.3
2. Weisberg: 2.4.1, 2.4.2, 2.4.3
3. Weisberg: 2.12
4. Suppose we are working with the model $Y_i = \beta x_i + \varepsilon_i, \varepsilon_i \overset{iid}\sim N(0, \sigma^2)$. 
    a. What is the MLE of $\beta$ for this model?
    b. What is the interpretation of $\beta_1$?
    c. Why might this model be problematic for many types of data?
    d. Describe how to transform the response $Y_i$ so that the model is appropriate in general.
5. Explain why $\hat\beta_0$ and $\hat\beta_1$ in the simple linear regression model are normally distributed.
